# Recipe Suggestion Helper – CLI AI Chatbot
**AIEG F25 Capstone Project**

## 🎯 Quick Pitch
A conversational CLI chatbot that helps users discover recipes based on ingredients they have at home. Users tell it what's in their pantry, get 2–3 suggestions, and ask follow-up questions about preparation, cooking time, and ingredient substitutions.

---

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **Ingredient-Based Matching** – Type ingredients → get matching recipes (minimum 2 ingredients matched)
- **Dietary Filters** – Support for vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian, halal, and kosher diets
- **Recipe Details** – Step-by-step cooking instructions with prep times
- **Smart Substitutions** – Suggest alternatives for ingredients you don't have
- **Natural Conversation** – Handles 4–5 intent types (list ingredients, get suggestions, explain recipe, ask questions, exit)
- **Graceful Error Handling** – Friendly messages for unclear input or no matches

### Intent Recognition
1. **List Ingredients** – User provides pantry items
2. **Get Suggestions** – Bot returns matching recipes
3. **Explain Recipe** – Detailed steps for selected recipe
4. **Ask Questions** – Handle substitutions, time estimates, dietary queries
5. **Exit** – Graceful farewell and session end

## 🚀 Quickstart

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- No external API key required (works fully offline)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/davvvidk03/g5.git
cd g5

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Run the CLI

```bash
python main.py
```

**Example Conversation:**
```
Hi! I'm your Recipe Suggestion Helper.
Available dietary options: halal, kosher, pescatarian, vegan, vegetarian
Do you have any dietary preferences? (or press Enter to skip)
> vegan

Tell me what ingredients you have (comma-separated). Example: 'chicken, rice, broccoli'
What ingredients do you have?
> tofu, broccoli, garlic

Great! Here are some recipes you can make:
1. Tofu Stir-Fry (20 minutes) — vegan, vegetarian — matches 3 ingredient(s)
2. Lentil & Vegetable Curry (30 minutes) — vegan, vegetarian — matches 2 ingredient(s)

Which number would you like to know more about, or type a recipe name? (or 'no' to exit)
> 1

Tofu Stir-Fry (20 minutes)
Dietary tags: vegan, vegetarian

- Step 1: Press tofu and cut into cubes.
- Step 2: Pan-fry tofu until golden, set aside.
- Step 3: Stir-fry veggies and garlic, add tofu back with soy sauce, cook until done.

Anything else? Ask for substitutions, time, or 'want to make this' to confirm, or 'exit'
> How long does it take?
This recipe takes about 20 minutes
> exit
Bye — happy cooking!
```

### Conversation Flow
```
Start
  │
  ├─→ Ask: Diet preference?
  │     (Vegan / Vegetarian / Pescatarian / Halal / Kosher / Skip)
  │
  ├─→ Ask: What ingredients?
  │     (Parse comma-separated input)
  │
  ├─→ Match recipes (≥2 matching ingredients + diet filter)
  │     │
  │     ├─→ [Found matches] → Show top 3
  │     │                      │
  │     │                      ├─→ User selects recipe

## 💻 Code Quality

### Modular Design
- **`main.py`** – User interaction and CLI flow (47 lines)
- **`src/recipe_helper.py`** – Core algorithms and recipe logic (96 lines)
  - Recipe matching with configurable thresholds
  - Dietary filtering
  - Substitution hints
  - Utility functions for parsing and normalization
- **`recipes.json`** – Declarative recipe database (no hardcoding in code)

### Error Handling
- **Missing recipes** → Prompt user to try different ingredients
- **Invalid selection** → Re-ask user or exit gracefully
- **Empty input** → Politely ask again
- **No matches for diet** → Suggest trying without diet filter

### Documentation
- Inline docstrings in `recipe_helper.py`
- README with architecture diagrams
- DEMO.md with example intents
- ETHICS.md for responsible AI considerations

## 🔐 Responsibility & Ethics

See **[ETHICS.md](ETHICS.md)** for:
- **Privacy** – No user data is logged or stored
- **Bias** – Recipe database covers multiple dietary preferences and cuisines
- **Accuracy** – Recipes are simplified; users should verify cooking temps/times
- **Limitations** – No nutritional info, allergy warnings, or real-time ingredient pricing
- **Future Improvements** – Add allergen flags, dietary customization, nutritional data

---

## 🤖 Responsible AI Use

We used AI assistants to help plan this project and write starter text and code in plain beginner-friendly language.

### Our Responsibilities as the Students

- ✅ **We read and edited all generated content** to make sure we understand it
- ✅ **We ran the code and tests ourselves** to verify everything works
- ✅ **We fixed any mistakes or confusing parts** that the AI generated
- ✅ **We wrote the final commit messages and pull request descriptions in our own words**
- ✅ **AI does not replace our learning or testing. It is a helper. We remain responsible for what we submit.**
